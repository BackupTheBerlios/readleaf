RedLeaf is yet another web-server/httpd daemon/call it like you
want/etc ... 
It's written jusr for fun first, initially it was just 2 hours to get
it works, all other stuff was added in the same mode - quickly and not
so often - 0-1 hours per week for this project.
Anyway it can be useful for those who wants a new internal httpd or
whatelse ... oh, or jusr for like an example of UNIX C programming.
